# Power-BI-Phishing-Campaign-Analysis
Phishing Campaign BI Dashboard
Project Overview
Phishing remains one of the most common and costly cybersecurity threats, often bypassing even advanced security systems by exploiting human behaviour.
This project uses Microsoft Power BI to transform raw phishing campaign data into clear, interactive dashboards that highlight where the risks are, who is most vulnerable, and how training can be improved to reduce attacks.

The dataset contains records of over 30,000 simulated phishing emails sent across multiple departments and locations.
By cleaning, modelling, and visualising this data, the project delivers insights that are easy to interpret for both technical teams and decision-makers.
The dashboards not only identify problem areas but also quantify the effectiveness of current phishing awareness programs.

Dashboards Provided
Campaign Manager Dashboard – Tracks phishing campaign performance across departments and locations, including open rates, click rates, and compromised accounts.

Individual User Dashboard – Analyses user behaviour, training completion, and risk scores to identify high-risk individuals and patterns.

HR Manager Dashboard – Breaks down vulnerability by role, department, and geography, showing where targeted training is needed.

Skills Demonstrated
Power BI Dashboard Design – Created interactive visual reports with filtering, drill-through, and cross-highlighting.

Data Modelling – Cleaned and integrated multiple datasets to produce a unified analysis view.

Storytelling with Data – Translated technical phishing metrics into a narrative that drives decision-making.

Cybersecurity Risk Analysis – Developed a framework to measure and rank vulnerability across people, departments, and locations.

Objectives
Show campaign managers which phishing campaigns are most successful and which departments are most at risk.

Help HR evaluate training effectiveness and identify underperforming areas or roles.

Enable targeted interventions by revealing user-level behaviour patterns and risk scores.

Detailed Dashboard Descriptions
Campaign Manager Dashboard
Emails Sent vs Opened by Department: Finance opened 4,000 of 6,000 phishing emails (67% open rate). Marketing opened 3,800 of 5,500 (69%).

Geographic Distribution of Link Clicks: Melbourne recorded 20 link clicks, Geelong 15, Ballarat 10, Bendigo 8.

Breakdown of Actions: 68% link clicks, 31% attachment downloads, 1% phishing reports.

Reports vs Compromised Accounts: IT recorded 20 compromised accounts with low reporting rates, showing a need for targeted awareness.

Individual User Dashboard
Training Completion vs Phishing Reporting: Operations completed 12 training modules and made 15 reports; Marketing completed 5 and made 8 reports.

Risk Scores by Department: Finance scored 1,050, Operations 1,000, Marketing 850.

Click Distribution: Marketing accounted for 27% of phishing clicks, Finance 23%, Sales 20%, IT 7%.

Tenure vs Risk: Longer-serving Finance employees had higher risk scores than new hires.

HR Manager Dashboard
Clicks vs Training Completion: Marketing had 18 clicks despite 16 completions; Recruiters had 15 clicks with 9 completions.

Phishing Reports: HR reported 16 phishing incidents; Finance reported 9.

Geographic Patterns: Melbourne and Geelong had the highest click counts.

Role-Based Vulnerability: Coordinators clicked 16 links, Specialists 11, Managers 8.

Key Outcomes
High-Risk Departments: Finance, Marketing, and Sales accounted for 70% of phishing clicks.

Hotspot Locations: Melbourne and Geelong made up 43% of all clicks.

Training Effectiveness: Some roles still clicked frequently despite completing training, showing a need for better content.

Role Risks: Coordinators and Recruiters were more vulnerable than Managers or Assistants.

Low Reporting Rates: Fewer than 10% of phishing emails were reported, risking undetected breaches.
